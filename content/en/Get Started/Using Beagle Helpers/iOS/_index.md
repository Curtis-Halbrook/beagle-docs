### Getting started
<hr>

To start using Beagle right now, you can use the libs below:
* [Beagle-Scaffold](https://github.com/ZupIT/beagle-helpers/tree/main/iOS/beagle-scaffold):
This lib will hold almost all configurations needed to start using Beagle in your project.
We advise using these libs for people that never used Beagle before.

* [Beagle-Defaults](https://github.com/ZupIT/beagle-helpers/tree/main/iOS/beagle-defaults):
This lib is meant for more experienced Beagle users and will hold only a few class configurations necessary to use Beagle in an application. These configurations include default Network, Logger and Cache classes. All these are also available in the Scaffold lib above.
