## What is it?

The Image widget defines a native image using server-driven data received through Beagle.  

Your structure is represented by the attributes below:

| **Attribute** | **Type** | Required | **Definition** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| path | [**ImagePath**](imagepath.md) or [**Binding**](../../../context.md#bindings) |     âœ“ | Refers to a local image or URL of a remote image to be exhibited. |
| mode | ImageContentMode |  | Responsible to control how the image will be internally controlled. |
